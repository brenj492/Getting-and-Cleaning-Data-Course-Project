This script is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. 

30 volunteers between 19-48 years of age participated in perfoming a series of 6 activities while wearing a Samsung 
smartphone. a series of 3 axial acceleration and 3 axial angular velocity measurements were taken. The 30 participants
were broken up into two groups, train and test, with 70% falling into the train group and 30% falling into the test 
group.

The script in this repository takes the prolific raw data generated by this study and organizes it. As a brief 
overview, it combines the train and test data sets, and extracts only the measurements pertaining to mean and standard
deviation readings. Train and test datasets were read into distinct data tables using fread() and converted with tbl_df() so it could be used
more readily with splyr tools. Column names were read from the "features" document (which contained the names of all the
561 measurements taken) using fread() and then converted into a character string. This string was then used as the variable
names of the  data tables using the names() function. The subjects and activities correlated with the measurements
were read in with fread(), given names, and bound to the data tables using the bind_cols() function in dplyr. Next, 
duplicate columns that were present in the raw data were deleted via subsetting. Only the columns pertaining to mean and
standard deviation measurements were extracted using the select() function in dplyr. This resulted in 88 columns: 2 columns
for subject and activity, respectively, and 86 for the pertinent measurements. The train and test data tables were then
combined using the bind_rows() function in dplyr. At this stage the activity indicators (numeric values 1 through 6) were
converted into more descriptive titles (see below). Finally, this combined data table was broken up into groups of 
subject and activity using the by_groups() function in dplyr, and the average for each measurement per activity, per
subject was calculated using the summarize_each() function in dplyr. This second, tidy data table was converted into a 
text file using write.table, and uploaded for the first part of this assignment on Coursera. 

The final summarized data table has 180 observations across 88 rows. The variables are as follows:

Subject ID: a numeric identification number ranging from 1 to 30
Activity: 1_Walking, 2_Walking_Upstairs, 3_Walking_Downstairs, 4_Sitting, 5_Standing, 6_Laying

The next 86 variables represent the average values of all repetitions each subject conducted of each activity, measured in Hz.
