This script is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. 

30 volunteers between 19-48 years of age participated in perfoming a series of 6 activities while wearing a Samsung 
smartphone. a series of 3 axial acceleration and 3 axial angular velocity measurements were taken. The 30 participants
were broken up into two groups, train and test, with 70% falling into the train group and 30% falling into the test 
group.

The script in this repository takes the prolific raw data generated by this study and organizes it. As a brief 
overview, it combines the train and test data sets, and extracts only the measurements pertaining to mean and standard
deviation readings.
